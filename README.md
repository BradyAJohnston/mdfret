# Package for processing of MD files in relation to FRET

Just a few functions that I have thrown together in relation to processing my MD files but calculating relvant md FRET traces etc from the trajectory files, read in with bio3d.

Dependencies are; 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(bio3d)
library(reshape2)
library(patchwork)
```

More to come _hopefully_.
