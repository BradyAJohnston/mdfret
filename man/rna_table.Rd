\title{Data Table of Experimental RNA}
\format{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
 \item(name){Name given to the sequnce, BAJ_01-BAJ_13 and noRNA.}
 \item(latex_name){Name that has escaped underscores "\_" for LaTeX formatting.}
 \item(raw_seq){RNA sequence, 5สน to 3สน of each RNA.}
 \item(html_seq){Sequences with mismatch to BAJ_01 highilgihted in RED using html flags. Compatible with geom_richtext for labelling.}
 \item(mono_seq){Seqeunces with mismatches to BAJ_01 highlighed in RED and also a monospaced font, using html flags. Compatible with kable(html) for making tables.}
 \item(latex_seq){Sequences with misatch to BAJ_01 highlighed in RED with LaTeX formatting and also a monospaced font. Compatible with kable(latex) for makint tables.}

\usage{
data(rna_table)

\description{
Sequences of RNA for MD and FRET experiments. Raw sequences are available, as well as some
pre-formatted sequences for use in geom_richtext and kable for both html and LaTeX, that highlight
the mismatches between these and the target RNA sequence.
